All dishes were well prepared with the best ingredients and of course loads of shaved truffles! The wine pairing with the tasting menu is also to the point, which greatly enhances the enjoyment of the dishes. The only complaints are the pre-appetizers which were not complex enough and way too salty. Service is very warm and professional. And the views of the opera house and Sydney bridge are a plus.
