The wok fried beans were stir fried perfectly and had a nice char and crunch to it.\n\nThe dumplings were incredible, we had the English spinach, mushroom and sweet corn, and pandan choysum dumplings. All were gluten free as well and exquisitely made, very soft skin thatâ€™s packed with delicious filling. They also had homemade chilli oil on each table and they were perfect to go with the dumplings.\n\nFor dessert I had the mango pancakes and they were awesome, fresh mango wrapped with delicious coconut cream and freshly made crepe. One of my favourite desserts.\n\nAll the food we had were gluten free except the chilli chicken and mango pancakes. My partner is coeliac and enjoyed the gluten free options with no issues. Will definitely be back!",
